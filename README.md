# Build, test and run project

`CmakeFileLists.txt` have two options: `BUILD_MAIN` and `BUILD_TEST` (both are enabled by default). First one controles building of main executable `simulator`, second one - building tests for it (`test_simulator`).

It is assumed that build files locates in `build` directory. You may do it the way you wish, but [Cmake Tools extention](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-quickstart) for VSCode is recomended.
